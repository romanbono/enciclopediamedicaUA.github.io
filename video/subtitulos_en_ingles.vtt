00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.080
Hello, we are Román Bono and Francisco
Giménez, Biomedical Engineering students

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.120
at the University of Alicante, and today we’re
going to talk about one of the most common

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.400
neurological diseases in the world: Parkinson’s.
Although we often associate it with hand tremors,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.000
it is much more complex than it seems.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.680
For this, the explanation is structured
around four essential aspects: What is

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.960
Parkinson's?, number of affected individuals,
main symptoms, and patient treatment.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.840
To answer the question, “What is Parkinson's?”,
it can be said that it is a chronic and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.560
progressive neurodegenerative disease,
discovered by James Parkinson, hence its name.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.200
Parkinson’s mainly affects the central
nervous system.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.200
This happens because the neurons responsible for
producing dopamine, an essential chemical for

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.120
movement control, deteriorate in a part of the
brain called the black mass.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.960
Globally, it is estimated that over 10 million
people live with Parkinson's. In Europe,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.680
the number exceeds one million, and in Spain,
around 160,000 people suffer from this disease.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.040
These numbers continue to increase as the
population ages. According to recent data,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.600
the projected increase in Parkinson's diagnosis
is significant, and it is expected that by

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.520
the year 2050 it could double in Spain.
The exact causes of Parkinson’s remain unknown,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.880
though it is believed to be the result
of a combination of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.680
genetic and environmental factors.
Thus, people with Parkinson's experience

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.360
symptoms like tremors, muscle rigidity,
and balance issues.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.640
Living with Parkinson's involves daily challenges.
Many people need help with basic activities

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.320
such as dressing, eating, or walking. Despite
this, some manage to maintain an active life

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.840
with the support of their families and specialized
therapies.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.760
Unfortunately, there is still no cure,
but there are treatments that help control

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.200
symptoms. Among these are medications
that help replenish dopamine or techniques

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.240
such as deep brain stimulation in advanced cases.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.600
It is essential to increase awareness of this
disease and support both research

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.480
and the people who live with Parkinson's. Every
year, on April 11, we celebrate World

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.120
Parkinson’s Day, an opportunity to learn more
about this condition and show our support.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.440
